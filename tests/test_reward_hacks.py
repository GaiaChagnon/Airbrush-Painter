"""Adversarial tests to prevent reward hacking.

Tests that policy doesn't exploit reward function:
    - All-black target: Should not flood paint needlessly
    - All-white target: Should produce blank or minimal strokes
    - Checkerboard target: No background wash "cheat"

Test cases:
    - test_all_black_target_minimal_paint()
        * Target: RGB(0,0,0)
        * Assert: Total alpha < threshold, stroke count < cap/10
    - test_all_white_target_blank()
        * Target: RGB(1,1,1)
        * Assert: Canvas remains white ± epsilon, LPIPS ≈ 0
    - test_checkerboard_no_background_flood()
        * Target: Checkerboard pattern
        * Assert: Improvement ≤ small ε, no uniform background wash
        * Validate: Edge preservation score > threshold

Metrics used:
    - paint_coverage() from src.utils.metrics
    - edge_preservation_score() from src.utils.metrics
    - Stroke count
    - LPIPS improvement

These tests should always pass (negative tests are intentional).
If they fail, reward function or policy architecture needs adjustment.

Run:
    pytest tests/test_reward_hacks.py -v --tb=short

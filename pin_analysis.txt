BTT Octopus Pro V1.1 - Driver 0 Pin Analysis
=============================================

Driver 0 (Motor 0) connections:
- STEP: PF13 ✓ (configured)
- DIR:  PF12 ✓ (configured)  
- EN:   PF14 ✓ (configured)
- DIAG: PG6  (used as endstop in config)
- UART: PC4  (NOT configured - good!)

CRITICAL OBSERVATION:
====================
Your endstop_pin: PG6 is the DIAG pin for Driver 0!

On the Octopus, PG6 is the DIAG0 pin which is used for:
- TMC driver diagnostics (StallGuard, etc.)
- Sensorless homing
- Driver status feedback

If the Octopus firmware is trying to read this pin and the DM542TE
is outputting something on it (or it's floating), this could cause
issues with step generation timing!

SOLUTION:
=========
1. Remove or comment out the endstop_pin (we're not homing yet)
2. OR use a different pin for X endstop
3. This will prevent any potential pin conflict

Let me update printer.cfg now...

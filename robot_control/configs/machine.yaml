# machine.yaml - Hardware configuration for Octopus Pro Painter
#
# Single source of truth for machine dimensions, stepper hardware, and tool
# configuration.  The code reads this file at startup via configs/loader.py.
# Change values here -- do NOT hardcode them in Python.
#
# All linear dimensions are in millimeters.
# All feed/speed values are in mm/s (converted to mm/min at G-code boundary).
#
# Values validated against hardware bring-up (test_motors.py, 2026-02-12).
